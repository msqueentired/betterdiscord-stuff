# Queen  Tired's BetterDiscord Stuff

A collection of the things I've created for BetterDiscord. Currently only a collection of CSS snippets that were originally gists.

## CSS Snippets

* [Blurred Spoilers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msqueentired/betterdiscord-stuff/main/css-snippets/blurred-spoilers.css) - Blurs spoiled text instead of blacking it out. Those bubble popping messages won't hit like they used to. Sorry. (Not really)
* [NSFW Badges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msqueentired/betterdiscord-stuff/main/css-snippets/retractable-topic.css) - Adds an 18+ badge to NSFW channels. I saw someone do this as a JS addon and thought it would work better as raw CSS.
* [Retractable Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msqueentired/betterdiscord-stuff/main/css-snippets/retractable-members.css) - Retracts the server members list into only icons unless it's hovered over
* [Retractable Topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msqueentired/betterdiscord-stuff/main/css-snippets/retractable-topic.css) - Hides channel topics unless they top bar is hovered over. I'm not responsible for any trouble you get into not reading a channel's rules :^)

### Using the channel snippets

Right click on the links above and copy the raw URL, then paste them into your theme or custom css using this format:

```css
@import url("THEME_RAW_URL_HERE");
```
